Testing roles
-------------

Testing roles with molecule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Launch `make execute_molecule` to test all collections roles.

Roles can be tested individually using the *molecule-venv* created by running
`make execute_molecule`. The *molecule-venv* can also be created manually.

.. code-block:: console

    % python3 -m venv molecule-venv
    % source molecule-venv/bin/activate
    (molecule-venv) % pip install --upgrade pip
    (molecule-venv) % pip install -r molecule-requirements.txt

Afterwards the *molecule-venv* can be used to test a specific role.
Note however that not all roles can be tested in a container, some may require
a full-fledged VM. To make sure your role can be tested in a container,
check the `driver` section in the `molecule.yml` file.

.. code-block:: console

    (molecule-venv) % cd roles/edpm_<role>
    (molecule-venv) % molecule test # tests default scenario
    (molecule-venv) % molecule test --all
    (molecule-venv) % molecule test --scenario-name <specific scenario>

The `edpm_timezone` role molecule directory is a working example to
borrow from when configuring the molecule directory for a new role.
Copying the default `molecule.yml` file from `edpm_timezone` should
be sufficient for the `molecule test` command to work.

Alternatively you can test roles in with :ref:`AnsibleEE<testing with ansibleee>`.

Creating a VM to run molecule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The
`edpm_libvirt <https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/edpm-ansible/tree/main/roles/edpm_libvirt>`_
molecule senario uses the delegated driver to run against localhost.
Thus, it's better to run it inside an ephemeral virtual machine as
it cannot be run insider of a container.

Boot a VM based on `CentOS-Stream-GenericCloud-9-latest.x86_64.qcow2`
from https://cloud.centos.org/centos/9-stream/x86_64/images.

Use `repo-setup <https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/repo-setup>`_
to configure the DNF repositories of the VM.

.. code-block:: console

    pushd /tmp
    curl -sL https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/repo-setup/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar -xz
    pushd repo-setup-main
    python3 -m venv ./venv
    PBR_VERSION=0.0.0 ./venv/bin/pip install ./
    sudo ./venv/bin/repo-setup current-podified
    popd
    popd

Clone the git repository on the VM.

.. code-block:: console

    cd ~
    sudo dnf install -y git
    git clone git@github.com:openstack-k8s-operators/edpm-ansible.git

Prepare molecule.

.. code-block:: console

    pushd ~/edpm-ansible
    python3 -m venv molecule-venv
    source molecule-venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install bindep
    bindep -b | xargs sudo dnf -y --setopt=install_weak_deps=False install
    pip install -r molecule-requirements.txt
    popd

Consider taking a snapshot of the VM before running a test like the
following.

.. code-block:: console

    cd ~/edpm-ansible/roles/edpm_libvirt/
    molecule test --all


Writing molecule tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Molecule scenario configutration is made up of several files, all
stored in the `molecule/<scenario>/` directory.

* `molecule/default/molecule.yml` (mandatory):
    Main configuration file for molecule test, where the driver, platforms, images,
    provisioner, verifier etc. are specified. The most important part of the molecule.yml file
    is the `scenario` section where the `test_sequence` is being specified. E.g.:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        test_sequence:
        - dependency
        - destroy
        - create
        - prepare
        - converge
        - destroy

* `molecule/default/converge.yml` (mandatory):
    Corresponding to the converge step.
    Molecule will run this playbook to apply the role to the test instance(s).

* `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
    Corresponding to the prepare step.
    It is used to perform any setup tasks that need to be done before your role can be applied.

* `molecule/default/verify.yml`:
    Corresponding to the verify step. This playbook is run to verify that the role did what was expected it to do.

The `create`, `destroy`, `dependency`, `side_effect` steps and other `configuration`_ are handled
internally by Molecule and do not require separate playbook files.
For instance, when Molecule executes the `destroy` step, it uses its internal logic,
and any configuration specified in `molecule.yml`, to destroy the test instances.

However they can be customized further based on the specific needs of the role.
