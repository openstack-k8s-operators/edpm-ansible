    short_description: The main entry point for the edpm_users role.
    description:
     - |
        This role will create the users and groups listed in this variable and is intended to be used
        whenever we required users and or groups to be created on the host that match the users and or groups
        of the containers running on the host. it can also create directories and set their ownership and permissions.
        This is useful for example when we want to create a directory on the host that will be used by a container
        to share content with a process running on the host like ovs-dpdk. ovs-dpdk requires a directory to be created
        to share vhost-user unix socket between qemu executing in the libvirt_virtqemd container and ovs-vswitchd
        executing in the host. that directory and the user and group of the vhost-user unix socket must share the
        same uid and gid when accessed form both the container and the host.

        description: |
          The list of directories to create on the compute node for communication with host processes.
          This shoudl only be used for directories that are required to be shared between containers and host processes.
          Where the host directories are created solely for the purpose of sharing content between containers or
          to persist data this should not be used.
