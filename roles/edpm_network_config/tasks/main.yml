# Main orchestrator for network configuration
# Supports three scenarios:
# 1. Direct nmstate via linux-system-roles (edpm_network_config_tool: 'nmstate')
# 2. os-net-config with nmstate provider (tool: 'os-net-config', edpm_network_config_nmstate: true)
# 3. os-net-config with ifcfg provider (tool: 'os-net-config', edpm_network_config_nmstate: false)
