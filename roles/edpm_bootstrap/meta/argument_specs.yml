          List of packages that are required for legacy networking to function.
          NOTE: We are using 'network' service provided by 'network-scripts' (initscripts)
                which deprecated in recent releases but os-net-config doesn't support yet
                NetworkManager. Until it happens, we need to ensure that network is started
                at boot, as it'll take care of restarting the network interfaces managed by
                OVS. Note that OVS unit service is already configure to start before
                network.service.
