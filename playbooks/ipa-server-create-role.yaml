# This playbook adds a role with the correct privileges needed by edpm-ipa
# and TLS-e to add hosts and services to the IPA server.  The operations in
# this playbook likely need admin privileges and should be executed on an
# IPA client.  This playbook only needs to be run once per IPA server as
# multiple edpm deployments can utilize the same role.
