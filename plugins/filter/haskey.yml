  short_description: Retrun dictionaries with given key
  description: |
    This filter will take a list of dictionaries (data)
    and will return the dictionaries which have a certain key given
    in parameter with 'attribute'.
    If reverse is set to True, the returned list won't contain dictionaries
    which have the attribute.
    If any_value is set to True, the returned list will match any value in
    the list of values for "value" parameter which has to be a list.
    If we want to exclude items which have certain key(s); these keys
    should be added to the excluded_keys list. If excluded_keys is used
    with reverse, we'll just exclude the items which had a key from
    excluded_keys in the reversed list.

  "{{ all_containers_hash | osp.edpm.dict_to_list | osp.edpm.haskey(attribute='restart', value=['always','unless-stopped'], any_value=True) | default([]) }}"
